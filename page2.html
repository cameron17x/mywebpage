              The buildup to Scott's first proper studio album involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles "Don't Play" and "Mamacita," and the March 2015 U.S. Rodeo Tour, for which Scott headlined, supported by Young Thug and Metro Boomin. Several of the dates sold out. During the same month, Rihanna's Scott-produced hit single "Bitch Better Have My Money" was released. "3500" and "Antidote" were released ahead of Rodeo, Scott's second full-length, which followed in September on Grand Hustle/Epic and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Toward the end of the year, "Antidote" peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 and became Scott's first platinum single.

              Travis Scott finally unleashed Astroworld on Friday, and the thrilling body of work is expected to dethrone Drake atop the Billboard 200 and land a number of tracks on the Billboard Hot 100. With Houston providing the main source of inspiration behind the project, La Flame's longtime A&R Sickamore shared with Rolling Stone that the Grammy Awards snubbing Scott's 2016 project, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, drove the rapper to craft an undeniably cohesive LP.
              
              "A real driver on this album too was when we got snubbed for the Grammys in 2016. That was a real dark day for us. We felt like we really worked hard and we really made a great album with Birds and we just got snubbed," the now Interscope Records employee admits. "We were like, man, are they not respecting us? That’s when it was like, 'No, y’all got it fucked up.'"
              
              He even goes on to credit the Grammy Awards snub as the best thing to happen to the crew surrounding Cactus Jack. Travis is yet to notch a Grammy nomination for his own headlining work. "We went back and wanted to make an album that was undeniable. The Grammy snub was probably the best thing that happened to us. It gave us a chip on our shoulder," Sickamore explains.

              Scott knew for this project to be perfect, transitions from track to track would have to be executed in a flawless manner. With that said, the ultimate goal for Astroworld was to turn the album into a cinematic experience for all to enjoy.
              
              "For this album, from Birds, we improved the transitions. A lot of classic albums, the transitions are really great. So we didn’t want people to have to hit the skip button for this album. We’ll do it for you," the self-proclaimed air traffic controller says. "Mike Dean, Travis, they really locked in to make sure it was really flowing from song to song. It’s like a movie -- a lot of the movie is in the editing, how it’s paced."
              
              Fellow Houston legend Mike Dean has played an integral role in all three of Scott's studio albums as an executive producer overseeing the entire operation. Sickamore detailed how once the album is done, Dean has the last call in the mixing stages to bring the LP to the finish line. He even compares the hard-working producer to New York Yankees all-time great closer Mariano Rivera. "We get it to a certain point, and at the end, we get it to Mike Dean, and he’s the closer. He’s Mariano Rivera," Sickamore proclaims.  
              The intro of Travis Scott’s ASTROWORLD is deceiving. At first, “Stargazing” sets the scene for Travis to begin his project-spanning journey into the heart of Houston rap, as evidenced by the second line in the song, “Sippin’ on purp, feelin’ like the Barre Baby.” It's a reference to the late Big Moe, whose song “Barre Baby” cemented him as a regional legend not just in Houston, but Texas overall. Midway through the song, “Stargazing” switches from a steady ride in the clouds to a jarring moment of turbulence, without so much as a gradual uptick.

This is exactly how Travis wanted ASTROWORLD to operate. While extraordinarily cohesive, the record never feels settled. Few of the beats stay the same from beginning to end, and none of them ring off quite like “Sicko Mode,” Travis’ first No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. It’s a three-part journey, and prominently features Drake at both the front and back end of the track. But its center—with a trunk-rattling beat, a vocal sample that serves as a tribute to Houston legend Big Hawk, and a boundlessly confident Travis—functions as the heart of the song, and of the album itself.

ASTROWORLD is characteristically eclectic enough to reclaim the attention of his devoted fanbase, which has been impatiently waiting for a follow-up to 2015’s Rodeo. But it’s Travis’ deftly sprinkled hat-tips to his hometown that provide an entry point for new listeners from Texas, which owes its statewide musical longevity to the likes of UGK, DJ Screw, and members of Screw’s S.U.C., like Lil Keke. Travis’ dedication to threading his sources’ influence throughout ASTROWORLD manifests as subtle cues and odes within odes. His strength as an artistic orchestrator is undeniable when it comes to the features, which are perfectly selected, down to Sheck Wes’ single-word contribution to “No Bystanders.” Scott brought the best out of every single one of his collaborators on both the production and vocal fronts. ASTROWORLD exists to keep us at the edge of our seats, just like the roller coasters Travis used to ride at the now-shuttered Six Flags AstroWorld, which directly inspired this album. ASTROWORLD is the sound of a new Houston, and proof that Travis Scott has reached a new level of superstardom
